## What is it?

Based on the famous gamebooks from the 80's and 90's Choose Your Own Adventure, Talechoose lets you create one of your own. Choose your own adventure is a series of gamebooks where each story is written from a second-person point of view, with the reader assuming the role of the protagonist and making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome.

You can create one of those stories and have it private or public. You can also play other people's stories, save them in your favourites and share the one's you create. Turn yoursef, your children or your friends into adventurers!
